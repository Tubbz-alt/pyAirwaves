Some short ISSUES log/infos

- Some planes doesn't have a lat/lon
google maps accepted creating a marker without lat/lon or null but not leaflet
but, some vehicles with lat/lon aren't trigger correctly
vehicles[vehName] seems to have lat and lon but in handleMessage it's triggered in the else { no lat / lon}
-> can't reproduce with console debugger in browser :(
so it spawn errors "Cannot read property 'setIcon' of null" in movePosition.
because this.marker is null / not created
my idea is that at some point the marker isn't created because of lat/lon missing.

- no pos -> then pos, no marker, sidebar toggle row dont work

- Change fill colors of markers
 active blue
 selected yellow
 idle grey

- Expiration timer: grey-ish old markers before deletion

- Better planes icons

- javascript cleanup needed





### new backend
Add config field for srcPosMode, c'est la position déterminée de la source, manuel vs gps
Utiliser un Enum
Initier une lib interne en elixir qui reprendra ces déclarations
enum sourcePositionReporting { manual, gps_manual, gps_auto } (auto unsupported yet)


FRONT FRONT FRONT; ADSB Struct changed (like alt->altitude, addr->hexIdent etc.)

in SBS:
course over ground isn't airspeed
and track isn't heading

let's accomodate the front and fill alt/addr/heading from not-the-good-values in the feeder.
